= speed-dial

Command line menu for easy access to applications and urls.

== Details

The application reads a number of menu-entry details, from a config file and automatically builds a working option menu for that data.
The configuration file contains the menu layout (with links between parent and child-menu's, messages to display when an option is pressed, keychars to press for a menu-item, commands to execute, etc.
This allows a user to build custom menu's in great detail, with the following possiblilities:
- create your own cli menu system
- link keychars to all the menu-options, for fast navigation
- optionally display a message, when a menu-item is chosen
- for a specified number of seconds
- optionally execute a command

== Configuration

The menu-items are stored in speed-dial-menu-items.conf.
